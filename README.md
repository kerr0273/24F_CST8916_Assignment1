# Assignment 1: Designing a Real-time Application with REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will explore how different technologies can be applied to a real-world use case involving real-time data management and communication. You are expected to demonstrate an understanding of REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets, and provide a recommendation for the most suitable technology or combination of technologies for your chosen scenario.

## Task
Choose **one real-world use case** from the following list:
- Real-time chat application (e.g., for customer support or social platforms)
- Live sports update system
- Real-time stock market monitoring app
- Real-time IoT monitoring system

For the chosen use case, complete the following sections:

### Section 1: REST and GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates
- **Explain** how both REST and GraphQL could be used to handle the data requests and updates required by the system.
    - For REST, describe how different endpoints could be structured, and how requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` would manage data.
    - For GraphQL, describe how queries and mutations could handle the same data operations and how this approach differs from REST.

- **Compare** the pros and cons of using REST versus GraphQL for your specific use case.

### Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Communication
- **Describe** how WebSockets could be used to handle real-time communication in your chosen system.


- **Discuss** how WebSockets differ from REST and GraphQL in managing real-time data flow.

### Section 3: Technology Recommendation and Justification
- **Recommend** which technology (or combination of technologies) you would choose for your system: REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, or a hybrid approach.
    - Justify your recommendation based on your analysis in Sections 1 and 2.
    - Consider factors such as data complexity, real-time requirements, scalability, and ease of use for developers.

- **Explain** why this combination is best suited for your use case in terms of performance, scalability, and real-time capabilities.

## Guidelines
- You are allowed to use **AI tools** to assist in your research, brainstorming, or drafting parts of the assignment. However, ensure that you **disclose how you used AI** in your work and critically evaluate any AI-generated content.
- Cite all sources, including any AI tools used.
- The final submission should reflect **your own understanding** and demonstrate critical thinking.

## Submission Instructions
- Write your solution in a **Markdown (.md) file**.
- Submit your assignment by uploading the `.md` file to a **private GitHub repository**.
- **Due Date:** Submit the GitHub repository link via **Brightspace** by **[13 October 2024]**.
- **GitHub Repository Access:** **You must** make your repository **private** and **add instructor as a collaborator**.
  - Instructure username: `ramymohamed10`
  - Refer to this guide: [Inviting collaborators to a personal repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

## Grading Criteria

| **Criteria**                                  | **Weight (%)** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity and Completeness of REST and GraphQL** | 30%            | Thorough explanation of REST and GraphQL for the chosen use case, with clear examples and comparison of how data requests and updates are handled in each.        |
| **WebSockets for Real-time Communication**    | 30%            | Detailed description of how WebSockets could be implemented for real-time communication, with examples relevant to the chosen use case.                           |
| **Technology Recommendation and Justification**| 30%            | Well-reasoned recommendation of the most appropriate technology or combination for the use case, with strong justifications based on performance and scalability. |
| **Citation and Disclosure of AI Tools**       | 10%       | AI tools must be disclosed and critically evaluated. Proper citation of all resources, including AI, is mandatory.                                                |



## Important Information (Must Read)

### Regular Commits and Version Control
It is highly recommended that you commit your work to your GitHub repository **periodically**. Use **meaningful commit messages** to describe the purpose of each commit. This will help you track your progress and ensure you have a backup of your work.

### Late Assignments
Assignments are due on the date and time specified by the course professor. Assignments **not submitted on time** will incur a **10% deduction per day**. After **5 days**, a **zero** will be assigned. Ensure that your assignments are clearly written, complete, and adhere to College standards to reflect a professional image.
> **Note:** Any changes made to your submission GitHub repository **after the deadline** will be **ignored**. Only the state of the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered for grading.

### Academic Integrity
As a learner, you are expected to follow Algonquin College’s **Academic Integrity Policy AA48**. If academic misconduct is suspected, it will be reported to the Academic Integrity Manager. This could result in a zero on the assignment or more severe academic sanctions.

### Permitted Use of AI Tools
You are allowed to use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to **assist** with brainstorming, drafting, coding, or problem-solving, provided that their use is fully disclosed and appropriately cited.

#### Requirements:
- **Transparency:** If you use generative AI in your submissions, you must disclose how it was used and cite it properly. For example, if AI helped draft part of your work, mention that in the `README.md` file of your repo.
- **Original Thought:** The work submitted must primarily reflect your own understanding and effort. AI-generated content should be integrated and modified by you.
- **Critical Evaluation:** You are responsible for verifying the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. Do not accept AI suggestions at face value without proper validation.

#### Academic Integrity:
- **Prohibited Use:** Directly submitting AI-generated work without modification, evaluation, or citation is considered a violation of academic integrity under Algonquin College’s Policy AA48. This is similar to contract cheating.
- **Consequences:** Violations of this policy could result in a zero on the assignment or other disciplinary actions as outlined in the college’s academic integrity policy.

### Collaboration and Individual Work
This assignment must be completed **individually**. Any collaboration with other students or any external person is considered a violation of **academic integrity** under Algonquin College Policy. All work submitted must be your own.
